    <h1>What is Forex Trading?</h1>

    <p>Forex, or foreign exchange, <b>can be explained as a network of buyers and sellers</b>, who transfer currency between each other at an agreed price. It is the means by which individuals, and central <em> banks convert</em> one currency into  another – if you have ever travelled abroad, then it is likely you <q>have made a forex transaction.</q>How does it <abbr title="As soon as possible">WORK!</abbr></p>

    <p><blockquote>“Trading doesn't just reveal your character, it also builds it if you stay in the game long enough.”</blockquote>
